# Basic_Business_Card_Compose

I have recently completed a project using Jetpack Compose, which involved developing a basic business card application as part of the 'Android Basics with Compose' course offered by Google. 
Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of key layout concepts such as row and column layouts, and also learned how to incorporate material design icons into my application. 
This experience has helped me to strengthen my skills in Android development, particularly in the context of using Jetpack Compose.

## Here is what the app looks like:
